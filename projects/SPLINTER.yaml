Description: SPLINTER (Structural Protein-Ligand Interactome), an interactome that
  predicts the interaction of thousands of small organic molecules with thousands
  of proteins through structure-based molecular docking and scoring. A list of the
  top-ranking small-molecule ligands is provided for each protein target in SPLINTER
  along with purchasing information for experimental characterization. The site can
  also be used to rank proteins for individual active compounds to provide a list
  of potential targets for experimental validation in cells or in vivo.
